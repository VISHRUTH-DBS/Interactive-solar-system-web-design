    <h2>Structure:</h2>
    <p>The Milky Way has a disk-like structure with a central bar and spiral arms.
        It is about 100,000 to 120,000 light-years in diameter.
        The galactic center, located in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius, is home to a supermassive black hole called Sagittarius A*.</p>
    <h2>Stars:</h2>
    <p>The Milky Way is home to an estimated 100 to 400 billion stars.
        Our solar system is located in one of the spiral arms, known as the Orion Arm or Local Spur.</p>
    <h2>Spiral Arms:</h2>
    <p>The Milky Way has several spiral arms, including the Perseus Arm, the Sagittarius Arm, and the Local Arm (which includes the Sun).
        The structure of the spiral arms is somewhat complex, and the exact number and arrangement are still areas of research.</p>
    <h2>Dark Matter:</h2>
    <p>The majority of the Milky Way's mass comes from dark matter, a mysterious and invisible substance that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light.</p>
    <h2>Galactic Halo:</h2>
    <p>Surrounding the disk of the Milky Way is a fainter, spherical region known as the galactic halo.</p>
    <h2>Satellite Galaxies:</h2>
    <p>The Milky Way has several satellite galaxies, the largest of which include the Magellanic Clouds (Large and Small) and the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy.</p>
    <h2>Age:</h2>

<p>The Milky Way is estimated to be about 13.6 billion years old, nearly as old as the universe itself.</p>
<h2>Galactic Rotation:</h2>

<p>Stars in the Milky Way orbit around the galactic center. The time it takes for our solar system to complete one orbit around the center is approximately 225-250 million years.</p>
<h2>Hubble's Law:</h2>

<p>The Milky Way, along with other galaxies, is moving away from us due to the expansion of the universe. This is described by Hubble's Law.</p>
<h2>Observations:</h2>

<p>Studying the Milky Way is challenging due to our location within it. Observations are often made in other wavelengths of light, such as radio waves, infrared, and X-rays, to better understand its structure and components.</p>
